    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
        1. Not opening any suspicious links as they could be malicious and designed to steal our information (like our usernames, passwords, credit card numbers). Or we might download a harmful program that can damage our computer or steal our files/information.<br>
        2. Keep the website's software and codes updated with the latest fixes to prevent malicious people from taking advantage of known problems.<br>
        3. Use strong passwords and special ways to make sure only the right people can access the website.<br>
        4. Implement HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). It will encrypt all data that is transmitted between the website and the user's browser. This will prevent attackers from intercepting sensitive information.<br>
        5. Regularly backup website's data as it will ensure that in the event of an attack data can be restored and the website can be up and running quickly.<br>
        6. Educate users about safe browsing habits and how to identify and avoid phishing attacks.<br>
